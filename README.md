Welcome to my project "ToDoList"
Which aims to learn a little more about the methods and synthaxe of Javascript.
On this project, I am writing and commenting my code so you can better understand how Javascript works and a ToDoList

Initialization:
Download from repository (or fork)
Open the file in your IDE (VSCode preference)
Launch the project locally, to see how it works: 
Adding a task to the input, click once to confirm that we have completed it, double-click to delete.
You are free to have fun and try new things with this project!
